remoteWebSlide
==============
A Python based web presentation tool

Simply point two devices to the server; one acting as the client, and one acting as the remote

Installation on Linux
---------------------
Requires both Python & Bottle

```bash
your-package-manager python
pip install bottle
```

& then you clone to repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackharrhy/remoteWebSlide.git
```

You are good to go!

Running on Linux
----------------
While in the repo main directory...

```bash
python server.py
```

Wow, now that hard part is over, you have to choose a port...

I give you the pleasure of doing it for yourself

Then, open your browsers to '127.0.0.1' or your local IP address, or whatever you want; you know what I mean, why do I even bother?

Installation & Running on Windows
---------------------------------

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
